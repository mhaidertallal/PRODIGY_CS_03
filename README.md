# 🚀 Prodigy Info Tech - Cyber Security Internship

Welcome to the official repository for my Cyber Security internship at **Prodigy Info Tech**! This repo showcases the various projects and tasks I completed during my internship, focusing on encryption techniques, security tools, and network analysis.

## 📚 Projects Overview

### 1. 🔒 Caesar Cipher Implementation
**Description:**  
A classic encryption tool that applies the Caesar Cipher technique. It shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet, providing a simple yet effective way to secure messages.

### 2. 🖼️ Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption
**Description:**  
An innovative image encryption technique where pixel values are altered to obscure the image's content, making it unreadable without the correct decryption key.

### 3. 🔑 Password Complexity Checker
**Description:**  
A utility that evaluates the strength of passwords based on criteria such as length, character variety, and the inclusion of special symbols. It helps users create more secure passwords.

### 4. 🕵️ Keylogger
**Description:**  
A monitoring tool that logs every keystroke on a system. This tool can be used for security audits to ensure compliance with usage policies or to detect unauthorized activity.

### 5. 🌐 Network Packet Analyzer
**Description:**  
A comprehensive network tool that captures and analyzes data packets moving through a network. It helps in identifying security threats, detecting anomalies, and ensuring data integrity.
